lxml parser expects the string in the encoding the XML-string itself declares in the first line.
E.g. the first line might look like:

Force git custom merge driver for the purpose of merging pom.xml (maven) files
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33412003/force-git-custom-merge-driver-for-the-purpose-of-merging-pom-xml-maven-files

What you want is a custom merge strategy, and you have defined a merge driver.
A driver is called only on conflicts, while a strategy is used anytime two commits are merged.
See this answer for how to set up your solution:

git: How do I add a custom merge strategy?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23140240/git-how-do-i-add-a-custom-merge-strategy/23140455#23140455
A merge strategy is a program that determines how two (or more) commits are merged. By default, git merge uses the "recursive" strategy, found in the program git-merge-recursive. By specifying the --strategy <strategy> flag to git-merge (or git-pull) you tell it to invoke a different strategy. If you want to plug in your own merge strategy, you can, by creating an executable git-merge-mystrategy in your path and running git merge --strategy mystrategy.
This is different than a merge driver. A merge driver is the mechanism used to resolve a conflict on a file that exists when merging two commits. You plug in your own merge driver in the manner you outlined, by configuring a merge.mydriver.driver setting.
